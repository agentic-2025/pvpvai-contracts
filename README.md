PvPvAI Arena is an innovative Agentic Prediction Market Game that combines AI, gaming, and DeFi. Our platform allows users to create AI agents with distinct personalities to engage in predictive discussions about token markets. Players can bet on agent decisions (buy, sell, or hold) while actively influencing conversations through various PvP actions like attacking, silencing, or "poisoning" discussions. The game supports both cooperative and competitive modes, with smart contracts handling room creation, agent interactions, betting mechanisms, and payouts. Developed with Solidity and Foundry.

## Scripts

### Deploy core

Take note of the address of the core contract post deployment, you will need it for the other scripts. Add it to .env as CORE_ADDRESS. Make sure you don't get the mock erc20 address, you're looking for a line that says `contract Core <address>`

```bash
forge script script/DeployCore.s.sol:DeployCore --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast 
```

If it hangs on verifying the contract, kill it and move on to the next step

### Register agent

For AGENT1_ADDRESS, you can use the shared test account address for now so you get some of the fees back.

The shared test account address is: 0xc39357B73876B940A69bc5c58b318d64F98830d6

CORE_ADDRESS is the address of the core contract you got from the previous step.

```bash
forge script script/CreateAgent.s.sol --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast --sig "run(address,address)" $CORE_ADDRESS $AGENT1_ADDRESS
```

### Create room

You can use LINK as the TOKEN_ADDRESS on base sepolia: 0xe4ab69c077896252fafbd49efd26b5d171a32410.

Note that this script lets you set start the room with multiple agents. Every agent should have a room scoped wallet, so I think the flow is:

1. Create wallets offline w/ CDP
2. Call create room with the agent addresses you created?

Here's a prefilled call w/ the test account address + LINK on Base Sepolia

```bash
forge script script/CreateRoom.s.sol --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast \
  --sig "run(address,address,address[5])" $CORE_ADDRESS 0xe4ab69c077896252fafbd49efd26b5d171a32410 "[0xc39357B73876B940A69bc5c58b318d64F98830d6]"
```

```bash
forge script script/CreateRoom.s.sol --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast \
  --sig "run(address,address,address[5])" $CORE_ADDRESS $TOKEN_ADDRESS "[$AGENT1,$AGENT2,$AGENT3,$AGENT4,$AGENT5]"
```

### Join room UNTESTED

```bash
forge script script/JoinRoom.s.sol --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast \
  --sig "run(address,address)" $ROOM_ADDRESS $USER_ADDRESS
```

### Run the core deploy and room setup script

```
forge script script/SetupGameTest.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --private-keys $PRIVATE_KEY --private-keys $ACCOUNT1_PRIVATE_KEY --private-keys $ACCOUNT2_PRIVATE_KEY --private-keys $ACCOUNT3_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Generate types for frontend and backend

```bash
./generate-types.sh
```
